# Infobip

You can use the [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/developers/) provider to send transactional emails to your customers using the Novu Platform with a single API to create multi-channel experiences.

## Getting Started

To use the Infobip provider in the email channel, you will need to create an Infobip account and add your API key and Base URL to the Infobip integration on the Novu platform.

## Generate API Key

To generate a new API key in Infobip, you can follow these steps:

- [Sign up](https://www.infobip.com/signup) or [Log in](https://portal.infobip.com/login/) to your Infobip account.
- Navigate to the [Settings](https://portal.infobip.com/settings/accounts/api-keys) of your account and look for the API Keys section at the top of the settings page.

## Create an Infobip integration with Novu

- Visit the [Integrations](https://web.novu.co/integrations) page on Novu.
- Locate **Infobip** and click on the **Connect** button.
- Enter your Infobip API Key.
- Enter your Base URL.
  - To see your base URL, log in to the account. Once logged in, on all pages you should see your base URL in this format: `xxxxx.api.infobip.com`.
- Fill the `From email address` field using the authenticated email from the previous step.
- Fill the `Sender name`.
- Click on the `Disabled` button and mark as `Active`.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- You should now be able to send notifications using Infobip in Novu.
